# Implementation of Business Intelligence and Digitalisation for Large Telecommunications Company

## Executive Summary:
A large Telco company wanted to create a modern Business Intelligence setup and implement various digitalisation strategies to modernise their tech stack and prepare for future market opportunities. The old setup was based on on-premise databases and ad-hoc reports on said database. The company needed a more robust and lean data architecture following best practices, such as dimensional modelling, centralized data governance providing one source of truth, and automation of reports and dashboards through Power BI.

Using my expertise in SQL, Spark, Python and the Azure stack i helped implement a modern business intelligence setup utilising Data Bricks and Power BI.

## Business Problem:

The company wanted to become more data driven, and the company did not know where to start. They had a lot of data, but it was disorganised and confusing. In short the company needed to:

1. Create a modern BI setup, that can scale.
2. Make better decisions on said data, by aligning on definitions and measures.
3. Automate repetitive reporting tasks across the company.

### Methodology:

 -  Map out existing data sources and determine new data architecture and tools.
 -  Map out upcoming data sources into the architecture (this included Adobe Experience Platform, Cognigy, Genesis)
 - Build a dimensional data model based on Fact and dimension tables for optimal Business Intelligence performance.
 -  Provide assistance with best practice for the use of Power BI and implement semantic models that could be used across the organisation as one source of truth.

### Results & Sample:

The end result is a large semantic model loaded into Power BI, that all relevant people in the organisation can build reports with.

Old Architecture is gone and the whole structure now runs on Azure, Databricks and Power BI.
